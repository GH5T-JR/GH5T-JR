I'm a 14-year-old from the southern part of Florida who wants to do video game development for a living, but to do that, I need to learn. Don't expect much to be put on this GitHub, but if I happen to develop tools for Unreal Engine that I want to share with other developers (when I learn to develop plugins after learning how to, well, use Unreal Engine), you will find them here, along a YouTube video showing the plugin and its abilities off.
