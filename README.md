I'm some dumbass Linux user who usually just draws stuff, makes YTPs, and very occasionally codes. I want to get into developing homebrew for the PSX (I have one behind me right now). I have to get all the neccessary software, code, test it in an emulator, and try to find rewritable CDs lying around, find a way to burn the game files since there's only one computer in active use that has a disc drive that belongs to my sister, and she won't react too nicely to me borrowing it, and then try to make the disc work on the PlayStation without using a modchip. I also need to learn C.
