- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the C++ Programming Language, Unreal Engine, and 3D modeling.
- ðŸŽ® I'm intrested in making games ALONE! That means don't pick my idea up and develop it. I want to be a one-man-band in game development. By one-man-band, I mean I want to do 
everything in the project, with no one else working with me.
